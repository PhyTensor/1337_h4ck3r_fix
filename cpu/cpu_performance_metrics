# 4 Critical Performance Metrics for CPU
	Context Switch
	Run Queue
	CPU Utilization
	Load Average

# Context Switch
When CPU switches from one process/thread to another, it's called a context switch.
On Context Switch, kernel stores current stat of CPU of process/thread in memory; kernel retrieves
	previously stored state of process/thread from memory and puts it in CPU.
Context Switching is essential for multitasking for CPU. Higher level of Context Switching can cause
	performance issues.

# Run Queue
Indicates total number of active processes in current queue for CPU. When ready to execute a process CPU
	picks from run queue based on priority of process.
Processes in sleep state/I/O wait state aren't in run queue. Higher number of processes in run queue can
	cause performance issues.

# CPU Utilization
How much of CPU is getting used. Highrt %age of CPU Utilization will cause performance issues.

# Load Average
Average CPU load over specific time period. Calculated by combining both total number of process in queue,
	total number of processes in uninterruptable task status.
