# States of CPU:
	Idle - nothing to do.
	Running User space program - e.g. command shel, compiler.
	Running Kernel - servicing interrupts or managing resources.

us = user space; percentage time CPU is running un-niced user space processes.
id = idle; percentage time CPU was idle.
sy = system; percentage time CPU spent running the kernel. All processes and system resources
	are handled by kernel. Scheduler is part of kernel. Amount of time spent in kernel should be as low
	as possible: Number can peak esp when there's a lot of I/O happening.
ni = nice; percentage time CPU spent running user space processes that have been niced.
wa = I/O wait:operations; percentage time CPU is idle while waiting for an I/O operation to complete.
hi & si = interrupts; percentage time spent servicing ineterrupts.
		hi = hardware interrupts. from peripherals e.g. disks, network interfaces.
		si = software interrupts. from processes running on system. occurs at kernel level.
st = stolen; applies to virtual machines. time stolen from this vm by the hypervisor. When linux runs as a vm
	on a hypervisor, st shows how long vierual CPU has spent waiting for hypervisor to service another
	virtual CPU running on a different vm.
IRQ & SoftIRQ = Kernel is servicing Interrupt Requests(IRQs).
Guest & Guest Nice = process (a hypervisor) is running a virtual CPU; These numbers are already included in
			User and Nice.


# Troubleshooting

A CPU rarely having any idle time is a) overloaded; b) sths wrong.

High User Mode - system jumps from having spare CPU cycles to running flat out, check time spent
			on user space processes. If high, process is eating up CPU time.
High Kernel Usage - A program with lots of console I/O can cause kernel usage to spike, if high for too long,
			sth isn't right, possibly problem with driver/kernel module.
High Niced Value - High ni value, some intensive CPU job is running and the task has been niced. If niceness
			is lower than zero, it avoids a CPU overload. If niceness is lower than zero, such a
			task can easily cripple system responsiveness.
High Waiting on I/O - intensive I/O tasks running that don't use much CPU time. If high for anything other
			than short bursts, I/O performed by task is very inefficient/data being transferred 
			to a very slow device/potential problem with a HDD that's taking long to process
			reads & writes.
		    - Consistent high I/O wait on system indicates problem in disk subsystem.
		    - Monitor reads/sec and writes/sec, usu measured in blocks i.e number of blocks
				read/write per sec; Also called bi and bo (block in and block out).
		    - tps; indicates total transactions per secs, which is sum of rtps i.e read
				transactions per second and wtps i.e write transactions per second.
High Interrupting Processing - indication of a broken peripheral causing lots of hardware interrupts/ process					that is issuing lots of software interrupts.
Large Stolen Time - host system running hypervisor is too busy. If possible check other vms on the hypervisor				 and/or migrate to your vm to another host.
