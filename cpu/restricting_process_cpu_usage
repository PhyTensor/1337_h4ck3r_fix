# Restricting process CPU usage using nice, cpulimit, cgroups

# cpulimit
curbs CPU usage of a process by pausing process at different intervals to keep it under defined ceiling.
Sends SIGSTOP and SIGCONT signals to process.
	e.g.g cpulimit -l % -p 1234

# cgroups
Control Groups, are a Linux Kernel feature that allows specification of how kernel should allocate specific
	resources to a group of processes e.g. specifying how much CPU time, system memory, network bandwidth or 
	combinations of these resources can be used by the processes residing in a certain group.
Advantage of cgroups; limits are applied to a set of processes rather than just one. Cgroups can limit other process
	resources not just CPU usage only.
e.g. CoreOS; minimal Linux distro designed for massive server deploment, upgrade process are controlled by a cgroup,
	thus downloading and installing system updates doesn't affect system performance.

###Creating cgroups
#2 groups called cpulimited and lesscpulimited

#cgcreate
	cgcreate -g cpu:/cpulimited
	cgcreate -g cpu:/lesscpulimited

	- the cgreate -g cpu:/ parts tells cgroups that groups can place limits on amount of CPU resources given to processes
		in the group.
	- other controllers: cpu, cpuset, memory, blkio
	- cpuset = related to cpu controller, allowing processes in a group to be bound to a specific CPU/set of cores in a CPU.
	
	# cpu controller
		- has property called cpu.shares, used by kernel to determine share of CPU resources available to each processes
			across the cgroups.
		- default value is 1024. We leave one groups, lesscpulimited at default of 1024 and have other, cpulimited at 512,
			kernel splits CPU resources using a 2:1 ratio.
		- setting cpu.shares:
			cgset -r cpu.shares=512 cpulimited
		-starting tasks in a particular group use cgexec command:
			cgexec -g cpu:/cpulimited <task/program>
			cgexec -g cpu:/lesscpulimited <task/program>

#SUMMARY
cgcreate -g cpu:/cpulimited
cgset -r cpu.shares=512 cpulimited
cgexec -g cpu:/cpulimited PROCESS
#When to use:
	- need to limit resource usage across groups of proceses and/or want to limit more than just CPU usage.
