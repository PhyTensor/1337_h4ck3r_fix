## Checking RAM speed and type

# Using the biosdecode command line utility
	# dmidecode = tool for dumping computer's DMI(SMBIOS) table contents in a human-readable format.
 

$ dmidecode --type 17
$ dmidecode --type 17 | grep -i "type\|speed\|size\|memory"

$ lshw -short -C memory		=	reduced info
$ lshw -C memory		=	detailed info
$ lshw -C [ memory|cpu ] -[ short|businfo|html|xml|json ]


(MegaTransfers per SECond) (Mt/s) = A measurement of bus and channel speed in millions of "effective"
		cycles per second. Also written as "MT/s," it is a rating of the actual, delivered
		speed rather than the frequency of the clock.
