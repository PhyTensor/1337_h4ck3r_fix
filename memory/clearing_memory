###CLEAR RAM CACHE AND SWAP IN LINUX

#It is a good idea to free Buffer and Cache in Linux that might be used by Linux Kernel

## 1. Clearing RAM Cache

	#sync == Synchronize cached writes to persistent storage
		#flushes file system buffer
	#drop_cache > writing to the file will clean cache without killing any application/service

#Clear PageCache Only
	sync; echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

#Clear dentries and inodes
	sync; echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches

#Clear PageCache, dentries and inodes
	sync; echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches


## 2. Clearing Swap Space

#Clear Swap Space
	swapoff -a && swapon -a
