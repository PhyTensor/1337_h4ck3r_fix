RAM == Physical Memory
Virtual Memory = Swap Space + RAM.
	- Contains both user and kernel space.

System bit does determine how much memory a process can utilize.
	-32-bit system, a process can access a max of 4GB virtual mem, on 64-bit, no limitation.

Unused RAM used as file system cache by kernel.

Swapping, done when Linux needs more memory than RAM can provide. On swapping, it writes the least used
	memory pages from the physical memory to the swap space on the disk.

Lots of swapping can cause performance issues.
